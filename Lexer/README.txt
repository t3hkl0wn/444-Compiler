CECS 444-01
Project #1: Lexer
Team: TVP = Tommy Van Pham (#012977339)
Intro: The objective of this assignment is to write a lexer for the A5 language lexicon: its tokens (i.e., legal “words”).   
The lexer transforms an A5 high-level program sequence of characters into a list of tokens for that program (in a special format).  
For convenience, this lexer will take input from standard-input (stdin) and send output to standard-output (stdout).  
Coding is in Java. 

Setup:
In the zip provided are:
	1) "444-p1-TVP-Lexer.jar" 
	2) "444-p1-TVP-Lexer" file directory
	3) Example input files (#1-3)
Both are methods of importing the source files into the user IDE.

On Line #19 of the source code is the file scanner that reads input from a .txt file, 
this line will need to be changed from:
"C:\\Users\\klown\\Desktop\\444-p2_TVP\\input3.txt"
to what the filepath is on your local device:
"C:\\Users\\(name of local user)\\Desktop\\444-p2_TVP\\input3.txt"

The file scanning line can be pointed at any correct filepath to a .txt file, the above is a placeholder example.

Once the correct filepath is added, the Lexer is ready to build & run.
